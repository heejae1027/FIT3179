        <h1>Bushfires in NSW</h1>
        <p>
          This dashboard explores bushfire activity in New South Wales (NSW) 
          using open data from 2010–2019, with a focus on the 2019 
          <b>“Black Summer”</b> season. Use the controls to switch years, filter 
          by fire type, and compare severity. Each section highlights a 
          different angle—where fires occurred, how large they were, 
          and how the mix of planned burns versus wildfires changed over time.

        <div id="nsw_map" class="vis-container"></div>
        <p class="vis-description">
          This map plots each recorded fire as a point located at the 
          centre of its footprint (centroid). Use the year slider to 
          step through 2010–2019 and the legend to isolate fire types. 
          Bubble size reflects burnt area, making large events easy to 
          spot while keeping the map responsive.

          <h2>📈 <b>NSW — Severity by Area (2015–2019)</b></h2>
          <p>
            <b>What it shows:</b> Fires are grouped by size: Small (<100 ha), 
            Medium (100–1k ha), Large (1k–10k ha) and Extreme (>10k ha), 
            and the donut shows each bucket’s share of total burnt area 
            for the selected year.<br>
            <b>How to read it:</b> Use the year slider to switch between 2015–2019; 
            hover to see exact values.<br>
            <b>Why it matters:</b> Most years are driven by Large fires, but in 2019 
            the Extreme bucket dominates, revealing how a small number of 
            mega-fires contributed the vast majority of area burned during Black Summer.

          <p>
            <b>What it shows:</b> The stacked area compares the share of 
            incidents that were planned/prescribed burns versus wildfires 
            each year from 2015–2019 (100% total per year).<br>
            <b>How to read it:</b> Taller orange sections mean a higher 
            proportion of wildfires in that year; blue shows planned operations.<br>
            <b>Why it matters:</b> The mix flips over time—2015 is mostly 
            planned burns, while by 2019 wildfires account for ~95% of 
            incidents, highlighting the shift from routine hazard-reduction 
            to a season dominated by uncontrolled fires. (Percentages are 
            from incident counts, not burnt area.)

        <p class="vis-description">
          Wildfires follow a strong seasonal rhythm in NSW. Counts sag through 
          autumn–winter, then build from late winter as fuels cure, peaking in 
          late spring to mid-summer (Nov–Jan) when heat, low humidity, and frequent 
          windy changes make new ignitions more likely and harder to control. 
          The late-2019 surge reflects this pattern, amplified by prolonged dryness 
          leading into Black Summer.

          <h2>🔥 Top 10 NSW fires by area (2019)</h2>
          <p>
            Reading the ranking: 2019’s damage was driven by a handful of mega-fires 
            — led by Green Wattle Creek, the single largest event. Ignited by lightning 
            on 26 Oct 2019, it expanded rapidly under record heat, long drought, 
            strong winds and very dry fuels, burning far more area than any other 
            fire that year. The remaining bars (Gospers Mountain, Carrai Creek, 
            Dunns Road, etc.) show how a few large incidents dominated the season’s total area.
